# Progress: Amul Protein Back-in-Stock Notification System

## What Works
*   Initial understanding of Amul product API structure.
*   Defined core requirements and system architecture.
*   Agreed upon monorepo structure for code management.
*   Clarified notification method (WhatsApp Cloud API) and key user interaction flows.
*   Established data storage strategy using Cloudflare Workers KV.
*   **Monorepo Setup**: ✅ Created `frontend/` and `worker/` directories.
*   **Cloudflare Worker Setup**: ✅ Worker initialized with proper TypeScript configuration.
*   **Frontend Structure**: ✅ Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files created.
*   **CI/CD Setup**: ✅ GitHub Actions workflows configured for both frontend and worker deployment.
*   **Wrangler Configuration**: ✅ Added `production` environment to `wrangler.jsonc`.
*   **GitHub Actions Environment Variables**: ✅ Added `NODE_VERSION` to `deploy-worker.yml` for consistency.

## What's Left to Build (MVP)
*   **Cloudflare Worker Development**:
    *   Logic to fetch product data from Amul API.
    *   Logic to store and update product stock status in KV.
    *   Cron trigger configuration for scheduled checks.
    *   API endpoints for user subscription management (register, subscribe, unsubscribe).
    *   Logic to send WhatsApp notifications using the Cloud API.
*   **Frontend Development**:
    *   Enhanced form handling and validation.
    *   Dynamic product dropdown implementation.
    *   API integration with the Worker endpoints.
*   **Deployment Configuration**:
    *   Set up GitHub secrets for Cloudflare API tokens and WhatsApp credentials.
    *   Create Cloudflare Pages project for frontend deployment.
    *   Test and validate deployment workflows.

## Current Status
Basic project structure and CI/CD infrastructure complete. Deployment configuration for the worker has been updated to address the `production` environment warning and ensure consistent Node.js version. Ready for core feature implementation and further deployment configuration.

## Known Issues
*   None at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
*   Initially considered email/SMS, but shifted to WhatsApp Cloud API due to user preference and favorable cost analysis for utility messages in India.
*   Adopted monorepo for better code management and shared logic between frontend and backend.
