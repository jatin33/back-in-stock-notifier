# Progress: Amul Protein Back-in-Stock Notification System

## What Works
*   Initial understanding of Amul product API structure.
*   Defined core requirements and system architecture.
*   Agreed upon monorepo structure for code management.
*   Clarified notification method (WhatsApp Cloud API) and key user interaction flows.
*   Established data storage strategy using Cloudflare Workers KV.

## What's Left to Build (MVP)
*   **Monorepo Setup**: Create `frontend/` and `worker/` directories.
*   **Cloudflare Worker Development**:
    *   Worker initialization (`npm create cloudflare@latest`).
    *   Logic to fetch product data from Amul API.
    *   Logic to store and update product stock status in KV.
    *   Cron trigger configuration for scheduled checks.
    *   API endpoints for user subscription management (register, subscribe, unsubscribe).
    *   Logic to send WhatsApp notifications using the Cloud API.
*   **Frontend Development**:
    *   HTML structure for the registration form.
    *   CSS for basic styling.
    *   JavaScript for form handling, dynamic product dropdown, and API calls to the Worker.
*   **CI/CD Setup**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment of both frontend (via Cloudflare Pages) and Worker.

## Current Status
Planning phase complete. All core requirements and architectural decisions have been made. Ready to proceed with implementation.

## Known Issues
*   None at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
*   Initially considered email/SMS, but shifted to WhatsApp Cloud API due to user preference and favorable cost analysis for utility messages in India.
*   Adopted monorepo for better code management and shared logic between frontend and backend.
